            <b>
                <i>
                    <center>
                    First  we can write the "king" or first code that are used to start "HTML" in all condition. it is used in all fields and in all conditions at starting. which is "<!Doctype HTML>"tag.

                <i>
                    <center>
                    Then we can write the "helper" or second code that are used to startn"HTML" which are used to change top heading of the page and It is also used in all fields and all conditions in "HTML" this code is "head"tag.
